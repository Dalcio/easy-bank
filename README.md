## My process

To build this project I start dividing the page into smaller components and I built all components one by one and then I join all components together.

### Built with

- HTML & CSS
- Typescript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Frontend Framework

### What I learned

Building this projects I could learn how angular works, what are directives and pipes and how to use.

### Continued development

I pretend to go forward with this project implementing routing making it more robust.
